# Character-Centrality-Interaction-Prediction
As the name suggests this is a model to predict the centrality and interactions of the characters of a novel(Game of Thrones).
Source of inspiration and dataset : https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/
It basically predicts the interactions of the characters on the basis of their past interactions and also categorises them.
Firsty It had a 36% accuracy when predicting the exact no of interactions but after classification it boosted upto 88%.
Since this is a hetrogeneous dataset , CatBoost is the algorithm used here.
